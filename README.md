This project entails verifying an implementation of a simple one-time-pad
encryption scheme. An OTP is a secure communication scheme which assumes
large (at least as large as the plaintext), securely exchanged keys and is
provably immune to cryptanalysis. The verification will be done on a toy
implementation involving short keys (and so supporting only short messages).
